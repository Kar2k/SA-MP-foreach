# SA-MP-foreach

foreach standalone include (non y_iterate version).

Y_Less dropped support for this version of foreach.

This version of foreach is 19 (0.4.4). This is the standalone version, so it does not require YSI. Use this version if you do not want to include YSI.

## Installation with sampctl

```bash
sampctl package install karimcambridge/SAMP-foreach
```

Then simply include into code:

```pawn
#include <foreach>
```

## Foreach option with more iterators out of the box
